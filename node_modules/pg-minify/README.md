**Features:** 

* Removes both `/*multi-line*/` and `--single-line` comments
* Concatenates multi-line strings into a single line with `\n`
* Fixes multi-line text, prefixing it with `E` where needed
* Removes redundant line gaps: line breaks, tabs and spaces
* Provides basic parsing and error reporting for invalid SQL
* Flattens the resulting script into a single line
* Optionally, compresses SQL for minimum space 

This library is originally for PostgreSQL, though it works for MS-SQL and MySQL also.

**Limitations:**

* Multi-line quoted identifiers are not supported, throwing an error when encountered.
* Nested multi-line comments are not supported - `/* /* nested */ */`.

## Installing

```
$ npm install pg-minify
```

## Usage

```js
var minify = require('pg-minify');

var sql = "SELECT 1; -- comments";

minify(sql); //=> SELECT 1;
```

with compression (removes all unnecessary spaces):

```js
var sql = 'SELECT * FROM "table" WHERE col = 123; -- comments';

minify(sql, {compress: true});
//=> SELECT*FROM"table"WHERE col=123;
```

The library's distribution includes [TypeScript] declarations.

## Error Handling

[SQLParsingError] is thrown on failed SQL parsing:

```js
try {
    minify("SELECT '1");
} catch (error) {
    // error is minify.SQLParsingError instance
    // error.message:
    // Error parsing SQL at {line:1,col:8}: Unclosed text block.
}
```

## API

### minify(sql, [options]) ⇒ String

Minifies SQL into a single line, according to the `options`.

##### options.compress ⇒ Boolean

Compresses / uglifies the SQL to its bare minimum, by removing all unnecessary spaces.

* `false (default)` - keep minimum spaces, for easier read
* `true` - remove all unnecessary spaces
