     * @event query
     * @description
     *
     * Global notification of a query that's about to execute.
     *
     * Notification happens just before the query execution. And if the handler throws an error, the query execution
     * will be rejected with that error.
     *
     * @param {object} e - Event Context Object.
     *
     * This is a shared-type object that's passed in with the following events: {@link event:query query},
     * {@link event:receive receive}, {@link event:error error}, {@link event:task task} and {@link event:transact transact}.
     *
     * @param {string|object} e.cn
     *
     * Set only for event {@link event:error error}, and only when the error is connection-related.
     *
     * It is a safe copy of the connection string/object that was used when initializing `db` - the database instance.
     *
     * If the original connection contains a password, the safe copy contains it masked with symbol `#`, so the connection
     * can be logged safely, without exposing the password.
     *
     * @param {} e.dc
     * Database Context that was used when creating the database object (see {@link Database}). It is set for all events.
     *
     * @param {string|object} e.query
     *
     * Query string/object that was passed into the query method. This property is only set during events {@link event:query query}
     * and {@link event:receive receive}.
     *
     * @param {external:Client} e.client
     *
     * $[pg.Client] object that represents the connection. It is set for all events, except for event {@link event:error error}
     * when it is connection-related.
     *
     * @param {} e.params - Formatting parameters for the query.
     *
     * It is set only for events {@link event:query query}, {@link event:receive receive} and {@link event:error error}, and only
     * when it is needed for logging. This library takes an extra step in figuring out when formatting parameters are of any value
     * to the event logging:
     * - when an error occurs related to the query formatting, event {@link event:error error} is sent with the property set.
     * - when initialization parameter `pgFormat` is used, and all query formatting is done within the $[PG] library, events
     * {@link event:query query} and {@link event:receive receive} will have this property set also, since this library no longer
     * handles the query formatting.
     *
     * When this parameter is not set, it means one of the two things:
     * - there were no parameters passed into the query method;
     * - property `query` of this object already contains all the formatting values in it, so logging only the query is sufficient.
     *
     * @param {object} e.ctx
     * _Task/Transaction Context_ object. See {@link Task.ctx} for details.
     *
     * This property is always set for events {@link event:task task} and {@link event:transact transact}, while for events
     * {@link event:query query}, {@link event:receive receive} and {@link event:error error} it is only set when the event occurred
     * while executing a task or transaction.

    /**
     * @event receive
     * @description
     * Global notification of any data received from the database, coming from a regular query or from a stream.
     *
     * The event is fired before the data reaches the client, and only when receiving 1 or more records.
     *
     * This event notification serves two purposes:
     *  - Providing selective data logging for debugging;
     *  - Pre-processing data before it reaches the client.
     *
     * **NOTES:**
     * - If you alter the size of `data` directly or through the `result` object, it may affect `QueryResultMask`
     *   validation for regular queries, which is executed right after this notification.
     * - When adding data pre-processing, you should consider possible performance penalty this may bring.
     * - If the event handler throws an error, the original request will be rejected with that error.
     *
     * @param {array} data
     * A non-empty array of received data objects/rows.
     *
     * If any of those objects are modified during notification, the client will receive the modified data.
     *
     * @param {object} result
     * - original $[Result] object, if the data comes from a regular query, in which case `data = result.rows`.
     * - `undefined` when the data comes from a stream.
     *
     * @param {object} e
     * Event Context Object.
     *
     * This type of object is used by several events. See event {@link event:query query} for its complete documentation.
     *

     *
     * All pre-defined methods and properties are read-only, so you will get an error,
